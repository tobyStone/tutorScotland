# Idempotent Override Restore Fix

## Problem
When users tried to restore an image override that had already been deleted, the system would:
1. Show a 404 error in the console
2. Display a "Restore failed" message to the user
3. Even though the content was actually restored correctly

This created confusion because the operation was successful but appeared to fail.

## Root Cause
The issue occurred because the delete override operation was not idempotent:
- When `deleteOverride` was called on an already-deleted override, the API returned a 404
- The frontend treated this 404 as a failure, even though the desired state (no override) was achieved
- The user saw an error message despite the restore working correctly

## Solution
Made the override restore operation idempotent at all layers:

### 1. Backend API (`api/content-manager.js`)
- Changed `handleDeleteOverride` to return 200 success instead of 404 when override is already deleted
- Added `alreadyDeleted` flag to distinguish between actual deletion and already-deleted cases
- Improved response messaging

### 2. API Service (`public/js/editor/api-service.js`)
- Updated `deleteOverride` to handle both success and "already deleted" responses
- Treats 404 responses as successful no-ops for backward compatibility
- Returns structured response object with success status and messaging

### 3. Override Engine (`public/js/editor/override-engine.js`)
- Enhanced `restore()` method to always clean up local state regardless of API response
- Always restores element content to original state
- Returns appropriate success messages for both deletion and already-deleted cases

### 4. Visual Editor (`public/js/visual-editor-v2.js`)
- Updated both `handleRestore` methods to use improved messaging from restore results
- Shows appropriate success messages for all restore scenarios

## Benefits
- ✅ No more false error messages when restoring already-restored content
- ✅ Consistent user experience regardless of override state
- ✅ Proper idempotent behavior following REST principles
- ✅ Better error messaging and user feedback
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility

## Testing
The fix includes comprehensive test coverage in `tests/integration/test-idempotent-restore.js` that verifies:
- Successful deletion of existing overrides
- Idempotent behavior when deleting already-deleted overrides
- Proper handling of non-existent override IDs
- Correct error handling for invalid requests

## Implementation Details
The fix follows the suggested approach from the tech team:
1. Made the backend endpoint idempotent (200 instead of 404 for missing documents)
2. Updated the API service to interpret "not found" as successful no-op
3. Enhanced the override engine to always clean up state and restore content
4. Improved user messaging throughout the restore flow

This ensures that restore operations always succeed when the desired end state (original content) is achieved, regardless of the current override state.
