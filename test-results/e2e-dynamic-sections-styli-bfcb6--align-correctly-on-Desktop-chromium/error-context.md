  - heading "💬 About Us" [level=2]
  - paragraph: Created by educators. Powered by purpose. Focused on every child.
  - paragraph: "Tutors Alliance Scotland began with a simple belief: that every child deserves access to safe, high-quality tuition, and that tutors deserve recognition, support and standards that match the difference they make."
  - paragraph: We are a not-for-profit professional membership organisation, run by experienced educators who've spent decades in the classroom, in leadership and in the world of tutoring. We know the power of one-to-one support. We've seen how it can build confidence, close gaps and change lives especially for those who need it most.
  - paragraph: We also know that tuition in Scotland is unregulated, inconsistent and unequal. Too many families don't know who to trust. Too many children are missing out. Too many brilliant tutors are working in isolation, without recognition or resources.
  - paragraph: That's why we created TAS.
  - paragraph: We're here to set a national standard for tutoring in Scotland, a standard built on trust, transparency and training. We support tutors to develop their skills. We help parents find the right support. And we work with partners and organisations to make tuition more accessible for children who need it most.
  - paragraph: 🤝 We work with our partners to support all children across Scotland, ensuring that no learner is left behind.
